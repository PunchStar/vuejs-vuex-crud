# VueJS-Vuex-CRUD
## Introduction

**Vuex-CRUD** is a library for Vuex which helps you to build CRUD modules easily.

## Installation

```
yarn add vuex-crud
```

OR

```
npm install vuex-crud
```

**Vuex-CRUD** uses `Array.prototype.includes`, `Object.assign` and `Promise`. Make sure hat your project use polyfill for those if you want to support older browsers! Look at here: https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/ for more info.
